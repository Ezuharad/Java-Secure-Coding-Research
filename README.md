This repository contains Java code audited for security vulnerabilities documented [here](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java). This code is being manually classified to be fed to a machine learning algortithm for detecting insecure coding practices.

## Methodology
Because our initial model is going to be focused on method-by-method classifications of security vulnerabilities, the current scope of classification is limited to the methods themselves, meaning that trust boundaries are effectively ignored in this analysis. There are future plans to broaden this scope.
